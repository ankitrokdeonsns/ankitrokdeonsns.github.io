I want to share my experience of admission process at [SERC](http://www.serc.iisc.in/) department at IISc Bangalore.  
I appeared for GATE exam in 2015. My AIR was 291. Gate score 774/1000. Marks 60/100. I prepared for GATE on my own without any coaching. I had joined online Test Series from [testbook.com](http://testbook.com/). I would recommend future GATE aspirants the same.  

I was eligible for M. Tech. (CSA), M. Sc. Engg. (CSA) and M. Tech. SERC. I had applied to all 3 programs.
I was only shortlisted for M. Tech. SERC. I had referred to few old blogs and couple of facebook groups to prepare for subsequent process at IISc Bangalore. I have shared those links at the end of this post.  

The admission process at SERC had two parts. A test followed by a personal interview. Generally you get the test and interview call letter 2-3 weeks in advance, so you have some time to prepare for it. I would advice you start preparing for these tests and interviews from the next day you get the result. The test and interview process at IISc spans across 2-3 days. IISc Bangalore did not provide any accommodation facility so you have to make your arrangements on your own. Fortunately I knew a friend Yogesh Bhosle who was pursuing his master's at IISc Bangalore. That took care of accommodation arrangements for me.  

The written test was conducted on April 20, 2015. I believe about 200 people were shortlisted for this test. This is just my guess since I don't know the actual number. The test was scheduled to start at 11AM in the morning. It is important to know these details since it will help you plan your travel accordingly.  

The test duration was 1 hour. We had to solve 30 multiple choice questions. As I expected from blogs that I had read it was full of mathematics. There were also a couple of programming output related questions. I would say the Mathematics questions were JEE level. There was negative marking. Here is a list of questions I could recollect from the test.  

* Find the radius of circumcircle of a triangle with sides of length 3,4,5 units.  
* Find the rank of matrix AxA' where A is matrix of dimension nx1.  
* Given a matrix A what is the type of matrix (A - A')/2 ?
* A dice is rolled five times. What is the probability that only one of the outcomes is odd ?  
* Number of solutions of a system of linear equations.  
* The is circular pool. A man can walk twice as fast as he can swim. How should he plan his journey so that he can reach the diametrically opposite point the fastest ?  
* Find out how many times hello will be printed in a program containing for loop.  
* If a matrix of dimension nxn is initialized as A[i,j] = (i/j) * (j/i) where 1 <= i,j <= n in a C program. What is the sum of all of its elements ?  
* What is x if log<sub>2</sub>(log<sub>3</sub>(log<sub>4</sub>x)) = 1 ?  
* How many arithmatic operations are needed to multiply two matrices of dimensions (nxm) and (mxk) if multiplication and addition are treated as arithmatic operations ?  
* Given two symmetric matrices A,B which of the following is true?
  * AA' = I
  * inverse of A = A'
  * AB = BA
  * AB = (BA)'  
* What is the sum of the roots of the equation x<sup>2</sup> + x + 1 = 0 ?  
* Evaluate 1 + (1/(1 + 1/( ... )))  
* Another question based on roots of a quadratic equation.  
* Given an isosceles triangle where length of its equal sides is 100m. There is a lamp post as the midpoint of the remaining side. Given the angle of elevation from each vertex of the triangle what is the height of the lamp post?  
* What is the value of cube root of i?  
* Couple of questions related to definite integrals.  
* What is the area covered by an equilateral triangle drawn on a sphere?  
* What are the equations of waves that make up a sign of 8 (in terms of sin and cos)?  
* What is frequency of a signal if its sampling rate is 1/10<sup>6</sup>?  

Out of those 30 questions I could solve only 16-17. They declared the results very late at around 7 in the evening. I did not have very high hopes. In the end I was not shortlisted. They shortlisted about 30-40 students as far as I remember. Each of those students was given a timeslot for the interview either in th morning 9AM or in the afternoon at 2PM. I returned to my home the same night from Bengaluru.
